    <h1>Comparison of Equity in Sports Categories in Power 5 Universities</h1>

    <!--     P5 VISUAL -->
    <p>
      Title IX was passed in 1973 to protect women from facing inequalities, specifically in 
      the sports setting. This website is a quick way to show how even after 50 years, there 
      are still many disparities by looking specifically at the universities within the Power 5 
      Conferences. The Power 5 Conferences consist of the Big Ten, the Big 12, the Pac-12, the 
      SEC, and finally, the ACC. These 5 Conferences consist of 64 schools. This data was retrived 
      from the US Department of Education and their Equity in Athletics Data Analysis.

      Select a category in the dropdown menu to see a bar chart comparing the amount of money 
      spent on Men's teams and Women's teams in three categories: Salary, Recruiting Expenses, 
      and Student Aid expenses, spanning from 2019-2021.

      Although technically, Title IX encompasses coaches, it is clear by this bar chart that 
      the Power 5 Universities don't spend the same amount of money on their men's and women's 
      teams. While this may be hard to hear and look at, men's sports are more watched and
      supported. This can support, in one sense, why these disparities are so high. If the coaches
      on the men's teams are under more pressure, the question of whether they should get paid more arises.
      As we can see, this is currently true and doesn't seem to be changing because the average difference
      in salary between the head coaches is slowly rising each year.

      To put this chart into perspective, in 2019, the average difference in salary was $930,201; 
      in 2020, the average difference grew slightly to $936,918, and finally, in 2021, the biggest 
      difference was shown, with the gap being $1,063,251.

    <p id="recruiting">
      This bar chart has the most obvious change during the three-year period. In 2020 we can see a 
      significant drop in money spent on recruiting for both genders. This drop coincides with the 
      COVID-19 lockdown and the halt of college sports. Although the disparities shrank during this
      year, the Power 5 Conferences immediately went back to their older ways. The differences went 
      from $801,840 in 2019 to $293,249 in 2020, and in 2021 this number was more than quadrupled
      to $1,330,416.

    </p>
    <p id="aid">

      The average difference, like the salary portion, has steadily increased from $1,640,968 
      in 2019 to $1,658,784 in 2020 and finally to $1,689,839 in 2021. 

      This data may look like the disparities in the Power 5 Conferences are high, but according to 
      the US Department of Education, "In determining whether a school is providing equal opportunity 
      based on sex in athletic scholarships and financial assistance, OCR considers whether the total 
      amount of athletic scholarship aid a school makes available to men and women is in proportion to 
      their participation rates." This puts the average differences in money spent seem less serious. 
      While Title IX is not being completely followed, this graph shows how quickly the difference can 
      be turned into something negative, when in reality, it is following the law.
